#  Electrical Load Forecasting using ML, DL, and Hybrid Models

This repository presents a comprehensive approach to **short-term electricity load forecasting** using traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Hybrid models. The project was developed as part of the final-year research work at **NIT Kurukshetra**, aiming to optimize forecasting accuracy for national grid-scale power demand.

---

##  Objective

To design, evaluate, and compare multiple models for **hourly electricity demand prediction**, using time series data enriched with weather and calendar features. The goal is to identify models that minimize forecasting error and improve grid reliability.

## Data Overview

* **Source**: Kaggle (Panama national grid dataset)
* **Granularity**: Hourly
* **Features**:

  * Historical Load
  * Temperature
  * Calendar-based indicators (weekday, weekend, holidays)
  * Lagged and rolling load statistics

---

## Models Implemented

### Traditional ML Models:

* Random Forest Regressor
* XGBoost
* Gradient Boosting

##  Methodology

* **EDA**: Time series visualization, correlation, trend/seasonality decomposition
* **Feature Engineering**:

  * Lag features (24hr, 48hr)
  * Rolling mean and std
  * Hour of day, day of week, holiday flags
* **Model Training**:

  * Used `GridSearchCV` to tune ML models
  * Trained DL models using Keras with multiple input/output time windows
* **Evaluation**:

  * Evaluated over **14 distinct weekly test sets**
  * Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

| Model             | MAE    | RMSE   | MAPE   |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **Random Forest** | 10.61  | 13.93  | 0.89%  |
| XGBoost           | 15.78  | 20.29  | 1.31%  |
| SVR               | 33.24  | 41.94  | 2.75%  |
| GRU               | 38.96  | 47.50  | 3.21%  |
| LSTM              | 42.38  | 49.94  | 3.50%  |
| ARIMA             | 210.63 | 260.47 | 15.56% |

âœ… Tree-based models outperformed both DL and hybrid setups.
ðŸ“‰ Hybrid ensemble (RF + XGB + ARIMA) underperformed due to poor compatibility.
